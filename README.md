This is a mashing together of these two projects.

Code is provided as is, with no guarantee. I take no ownership of this terrible code, unless it works then game on.

Currently, compiles and uses 70% of the program storage.

Open to any ideas of how to keep this tidy, currently just a stream of consciousness, don't do much "embedded" coding and it probably shows.
